# XML PythonParser
## Objective
### The objective of this program is to create a program using python that can parse xml formatted data

## List of tasks this program needs to do in order to work (cross out when finished)
_Will probably be expanded upon a little later_
1. Read a text file
2. Seperate text into a list
   - use .split() function
   - _write format rules here later_
3. Create and store variables from the list

I know there are a lot of parsers out there, but I'm creating my own as a learning experience.

If this ends up successfull, I will create parsers for other formats to solidify my skills
